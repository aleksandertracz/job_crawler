# job_crawler
A Python code to crawl job websites in Poland to support me in my job search. Websites supported so far: czyjesteldorado.pl, pracuj.pl.

### IMPORTANT ###
Please note that czyjesteldorado.pl does not allow automatic data download from their website, hence this code may not be used and can only be seen as a theoretical framework/base for a job crawler for other websites. Always consult Terms of Use of a website you wish to crawl.
